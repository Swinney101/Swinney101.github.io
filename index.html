        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            31 Year old USAF Veteran 2003-2009. I have returned to school to start a new career in technology. During my time as
            an intelligence analyst, I had the opportunity to work with many different types of computer systems and programs designed
            for analysis, weaponeering, and data mining. You can reach me through my email at the bottom of the page. The website is a
            work in progress. I will add more features and functionality as time progresses.

                    I meant to start this blog last quarter but I guess with my toolbox of HTML/CSS starting it now will allow me to practice
                    and expand upon what I learned last quarter in IT111. We I finally decided to focus my energies on a technical career one
                    of the prominent videos I watched mentioned keeping a professional blog/web page to document my learning and projects. So
                    that is what I intend to do, for now I will use the limited space on my netid page to hold this data.

                    I have enough HTML/CSS to migrate this to my own personal site but I only want to be working on
                    one web page at a time while I juggling school work as well.<br><br>

                    So getting to the main point of my professional blog, today I am working on becoming more proficient
                    with Unix BASH shell. I am currently working through the tutorial on safaribooksonline.com call Unix
                    and Linux: Learn by Video by Ron Hipschman.<br><br>

                    I have always wanted to become more proficient with command line interfaces after seeing their practicality
                    on the SYS/NET admin side of things. However, my recent jump into Django to expand my horizons with Python
                    showed me that I have a lot to learn working in the terminal. Now that I have a MacBook Air in conjunction with
                    my PC's I can easily work within and practice the BASH shell.<br><br>

                    I have started reading tutorials on the CLI for awhile and now I decided to create my own reference index to go
                    with learning the material to help solidify the learning process.<br><br>

                    Today I have scratched the surface with basic commands:<br>
                    - PWD<br>
                    - LS<br>
                    - Flags (ls specific)<br>
                    - (-a;-A;-l;-S;-t;)<br>
                    - cd <br>
                    - cat *filename* <br>
                    - more *filename* <br><br>

                    Most of this will become engrained the more I use the terminal to complete tasks opposed to relying on the GUI,
                    which works out particularly well since it has been at least three years since I worked with a OS X system, using
                    the terminal gets me to locations much more easily and quickly. <br><br>

                    The other plus side of doing this HTML and CSS is that it will force me to practice what I have learned and search
                    for new solutions for different elements and attributes.

                    So building on my CSC110 - Intro to Programming (Python), I am working through a video series called "Python Beyond the
                    Basics - Object Oriented Programming" by David Burke. So far the pace seems to work well, I am still struggling to grasp
                    some of the concepts around OO Python, but I think I as I work through some assignments and hand jam the code without following
                    along with code on screen, I will get some of those desired light bulb moments.<br><br>

                    So far the content has covered a few metaphors to better understand classes - with instances, Type, Attributes, and methods.
                    We are working through six points to understanding classes, instance methods, instance attributes, and encapsulation with
                    setter and getter functions. Hopefully the mud will clear as I continue plugging away through the course. <br><br>

                    So far typing.io has been awesome, while with normal typing I am quiet adept, effective programming typing is on another
                    field entirely with all of the character and trying to break bad habits removing fingers from the home keys to hunt and peck
                    special characters. At a minimum I am going to add at least twenty minutes a day of typing.io.
